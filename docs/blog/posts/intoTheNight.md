# Into the night - concept
you are a protogen operating as part of the Nova Embers missions

## The missions
!!! note
    these are currently references to games and movies that I like
### Cascadian Independence
` 432 years after calamity `

- not much is known about this war
    - at one point in the war, many nukes were set off causing a second calamity
### Lazarus
` 433 years after calamity `

- humanity has relised that will be uninhabitable within the next 50 years
- missions are launched to find humanity a new home 
    - the Lazarus missions fail leaving humanity without a viable home
        - humanity is living on hundreds of space stations only
### Crimson
` 495 years after calamity `

- station `st-556-d` has  started to fall
    - last 12 live humans in the solar system are on board
    - crew transfer to `rc-005-b-24`
### Nova Embers
` 1235+ years after calamity `
- since crimson, logs of events are not accurate 
- humanity no longer exists, after an event known as "the shift"
