# Into the night - concept
you are a protogen operating as part of the Nova Embers missions

## The missions
!!! note
    these are currently references to games and movies that I like
### Cascadian Independence
` 432 years after calamity `
- not much is known about this war
    - at one point in the war, many nukes were set off causing a second calamity
### Lazarus
` 433 years after calamity `
- humanity has relised that will be uninhabitable within the next 50 years
- missions are launched to find humanity a new home 
    - the Lazarus missions fail leaving humanity without a viable home
        - humanity is living on hundreds of space stations only
### Crimson
` 495 years after calamity `
