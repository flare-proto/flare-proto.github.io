# Social Accountability, Social Standards, and Cyber Bullying
"See something, Say something, Do something"[^1]
<!-- more -->
## Bullying
### The playground
"See something, Say something, Do something"[^1]

|               |                 action                 | How this relates to online situations |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| See something | If you see bullying                    | cyber bullying, online witch hunts
| Say something | Inform someone responsible             | Inform a moderator
| Do something  | Stand up for the person getting bulled | :material-arrow-left:

### The internet is not as simple
often online situations are far more complex, with no clear victims or bullies. Even when there it is clear who is the victim and who the bully is, the situation is still far more complicated, where both the victim and bully are in the wrong.

## Social Standards
the audience of a joke is important, you would not tell your grandma an offensive joke, the internet is similar.

Jokes that may be acceptable with one group of people, can often not be acceptable with another group.

When you post something online, if what you are saying could be seen as offensive, think twice about posting it, your actions have consequences and will always be part of your digital footprint.

## Social Accountability
Your online actions have consequences, nothing can be completely removed from the internet.

### Someone made an offensive joke
***If*** you are comfortable, tell them, and report it to a moderator.

***DO NOT*** publicly shame them, cyber bullying and witch hunts only make the situation worse.

### Don't be the annoying house fly
If you get blocked/banned, don't be the person that creates alt accounts just to prove a point[^2], instead move on and understand that different people have different opinions.
