# Final Embers
you are a protogen, cast deep into the snowy mountains by the crash.

Your radios... dead

rations... limited

hope for survival... grim

weather... blizzard

is it even possible to survive?

## The abandoned facility
just below bowl you landed in is a large structure

your only hope for survival is contained within its walls 

how abandoned is the facility actually?
