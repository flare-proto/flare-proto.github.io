# Moving Distros Again
Due to poor performance and not great experience that the person that I found out about bazzite through had, I have decided to switch distros
<!-- more -->
## What happened?
### Hostile devs
I had originally heard about bazzite through Cairo(@somefurrednerd.xyz) on bluesky, however today he had a quite hostile interaction with one of the devs, If you want to see that, look at this thread: [https://bsky.app/profile/somefurrednerd.xyz/post/3lw3hmzq6t22d](https://bsky.app/profile/somefurrednerd.xyz/post/3lw3hmzq6t22d)

### Poor performance
| Toaster Arena |  |
| ---- | --- |
| Engine | UE5
| FPS Limiter | 500
| Windows FPS | 300+
| Bazzite FPS | ~50

| Minecraft |  |
| ---- | --- |
| FPS Limiter | Unlimited
| Windows FPS | 120+
| Bazzite FPS | ~60

### System crashes
the system crashing has been a near DAILY occurrence, sometimes happening multiple times. I assume this is related to NVIDIA drivers for my 4060

### Generally just dont like the os
I dont like how Im not supposed to use the system package manager

## Moving on from bazzite
