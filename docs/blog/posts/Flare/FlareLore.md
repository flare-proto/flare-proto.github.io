## Lore
Flare is a `XRT-02 MK.5` model protogen(eXperimental Repair Tech design 2 MarK 5) serial number `F1AR3`, however, most just refer to them as Flare.

Flare is extremely genderfluid, and would commonly gets quite dysphoric before they developed the shapeshifting tech

### Shapeshifter
Flare is actually 65% artificial, they don't appear as such due to their flesh being infused with nanites.
Originally, the nanites infused in Flare's flesh were only able to repair incase of damage.
However, while attempting to make the auto repair faster, Flare accidentally reset the `/etc/proto/nanite/repair.conf` and `/var/proto/nanite/repair/state.prtg` files, triggering a full repair with the `bio-sx` flag incorrectly set to `F`. After 15min Flare suddenly noticed that they suddenly appeared fem.
Due to the sudden discovery about this partial shapeshifting, Flare developed a program that links gender to the `bio-sx` flag.

### Clothing
Under normal situations, Flare prefers metal armour, however Flare has been known to wear tanktops and croptops while fem.
On occasion, Flare enjoys wear thighhighs and arm-warmers.

- Most of the metal armor is removable
    - Except connector rings and the visor

### Joke Lore
- Flare growls like the AIM-9 Sidewinder
